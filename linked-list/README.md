# Linked List

### What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a collection of **data elements**.

A data element is represented as a **node** in a linked list.

A node consists of two parts: data and a pointer to the next node.

Data elements are linked using pointers and are **not** stored in contiguous memory like arrays
